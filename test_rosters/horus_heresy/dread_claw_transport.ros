          <description>CENTURION – draft ruleset 1.1
The Centurion Discipline is a middle-ground between Zone Mortalis* and Frontline* games.
Aesthetically drawing inspiration from Warhammer 40k 2nd Edition, and rules-wise
providing more narrative games where infantry and characters are the focus of
the action. Some units are restricted in this discipline, the narrative shaped by
dense terrain in which tanks and aircraft are not viable, yet the battle is still a
savage tale of retribution and massacre.

Centurion games are played on a 6x4 with more terrain than Frontline games,
using Shadow War missions and a points level of 1500-2000 to represent smaller
actions, insurgency, and tactical skirmishes.

Infantry, Walkers, and Speeders should be the focus of your army and the
following unit are restricted:

Tanks, Fliers, Drop Pods, Superheavies are not allowed.
Bikes, Attack Bikes, Jet Bikes, Artillery, Monstrous Creatures, Leviathan
Siege Dreadnoughts are 0-1 choices.

Note this precludes some Rites of War and Army Lists from Centurion mode.</description>

                  <description>• A Talent for Murder: If a unit or units of models with the Legiones Astartes (Night Lords) special rule outnumber one or more enemy infantry units during any Initiative step in which they fight in an assault, they gain 1 To Hit and To Wound. Bulky models count as two models and Very Bulky models as three models for the purposes of working out when the Night Lords outnumber their victims.
• Nostraman Blood: All models with this special rule fall back 1&quot; further than normal. If they fail a Pinning test, they may, if the controlling player wishes, fall back instead of becoming pinned - just as if they had failed a Morale check for taking casualties in the Shooting phase.
• Night Vision: All models in a Night Lords primary detachment (not just those with the Legiones Astartes (Night Lords) special rule) have the Night Vision special rule.
• From the Shadows: All models with this special rule have a cover save of 5 on the first game turn, even in open ground. This rule can be combined with the effects of Stealth, etc, as normal, but other forms of cover the model might be in which provide a higher save supersede it.
• Seeds of Dissent: If an army’s Warlord is slain, each unit in the army with this special rule must make an immediate Morale check as if they had suffered 25% losses from shooting</description>

                  <description>Units with this special rule may always attempt to Regroup at their normal Leadership value, regardless of casualties.

In addition to these benefits, units  will also have a number of additional special rules and abilities specific to their ‘named’ Legion, all of which will be defined in the Legiones Astartes Army List and other future Forge World publications.

If an army represents a Legion which does not yet have its own unique Legiones Astartes rule, the controlling player may instead add either the Stubborn or Furious Charge special rule to the standard provisions of this rule in the interim.</description>

If the test is passed, all is well and there is no effect. If the test is failed, the unit succumbs to fear – all models in the unit have their Weapon Skill reduced to 1 for the remainder of that Fight sub-phase. Note that a model that causes Fear is not itself immune to Fear, and will still need to take a Fear test if it is base contact with any enemy models that cause Fear.</description>

              <description>Units that contain at least one model with this special rule are deployed last, after all other units (friend and foe) have been deployed. If both sides have Infiltrators, the players roll-off and the winner decides who goes first, then alternate deploying these units.

Infiltrators can be set up anywhere on the table that is more than 12&quot; from any enemy unit, as long as no deployed enemy unit can draw line of sight to them. This includes in a building, as long as the building is more than 12&quot; from any enemy unit. Alternatively, they can be set up anywhere on the table more than 18&quot; from any enemy unit, even in plain sight.

If a unit with Infiltrate deploys inside a Dedicated Transport, they may Infiltrate along with their Transport. 

A unit that deploys using these rules cannot charge in their first turn. Having Infiltrate also confers the Outflank special rule to units of Infiltrators that are kept as Reserves.

If a unit has both the Infiltrate and Scout special rule, that unit can deploy as per the Infiltrate special rule and then redeploy as per the Scout special rule.</description>

If the special rule does not specify a type of foe, then everyone is a Preferred Enemy of the unit. A unit that contains at least one model with this special rule re-rolls failed To Hit and To Wound rolls of 1 if attacking its Preferred Enemy.

              <description>If a model with this special rule rolls a 6 To Hit with a Melee weapon, that hit is a ‘Precision Strike’.

Wounds from Precision Strikes are allocated against an engaged model (or models) of your choice in the unit you are attacking, rather than following the normal rules for Wound allocation. If a Precision Strike Wound is allocated to a character, they can still make their Look Out, Sir roll.</description>

                  <description>In order for a unit to be able to Deep Strike, all models in the unit must have the Deep Strike special rule and the unit must start the game in Reserve. When placing the unit in Reserve, you must tell your opponent that it will be arriving by Deep Strike (sometimes called Deep Strike Reserve). Some units must arrive by Deep Strike. They always begin the game in Reserve and always arrive by Deep Strike.

Arriving by Deep Strike
Roll for the arrival of all Deep Striking units as specified in the rules for Reserves and then deploy them as follows:
• First, place one model from the unit anywhere on the table, in the position where you would like it to arrive, and roll for scatter to determine the model’s final position. If a vehicle scatters when arriving via Deep Strike, do not change its facing – it must continue to face the same direction as it did before you rolled for scatter.
• Next, the unit’s remaining models are arranged around the first one. Models must be placed in base contact with the first model and begin to form a circle around it. When the first circle is complete, a further concentric circle must be placed with each model touching the circle inside it. Each circle must include as many models as will fit.
• Models deploying via Deep Strike treat all difficult terrain as dangerous terrain.
In the Movement phase during which they arrive, Deep Striking units may not move any further, other than to disembark from a Deep Striking Transport vehicle if they are in one.
Units Deep Striking into ruins are placed on the ground floor. Deep Striking units count non-ruined buildings (except for their battlements) as impassable terrain.
In that turn’s Shooting phase, these units can fire (or Run, Turbo-boost or move Flat Out) as normal, and count as having moved in the previous Movement phase. Vehicles, except for Walkers, count as having moved at Combat Speed (even Immobilised vehicles). This can affect the number of weapons they can fire with their full Ballistic Skill.
In that turn’s Assault phase, however, these units cannot charge. This also applies to units that have disembarked from Transports that arrived by Deep Strike that turn.

Deep Strike and Transports
Units do not confer the Deep Strike special rule onto a Transport vehicle they are embarked inside. A Transport vehicle with Deep Strike may Deep Strike regardless of whether its passengers have Deep Strike or not.

Deep Strike Mishaps
Deep Striking onto a crowded battlefield can be dangerous, as one may miss the intended objective or even materialise inside solid rock! If any of the models in a Deep Striking unit cannot be deployed, because at least one model would land partially or fully off the table, in impassable terrain, on top of a friendly model, or on top of or within 1&quot; of an enemy model, something has gone wrong. The controlling player must roll on the Deep Strike Mishap table and apply the results. If the unfortunate unit is also a Transport, the Deep Strike Mishap result applies to both the unit and anything embarked within it.


Deep Strike Mishap Table
D6 - Effect
1 - Terrible Accident! Teleporting units are lost in the Warp, deep striking jump units are shot down, or some other suitably dramatic event occurs.
The entire unit is destroyed!

2-3 - Misplaced. The coordinates were inaccurate or the enemy has jammed your instruments.
Your opponent may deploy the unit anywhere on the table (excluding impassable terrain, but including difficult terrain, which of course counts as dangerous for Deep Striking units), in a valid Deep Strike formation, but without rolling for scatter.

                  <description>At the beginning of the controlling player’s first player turn, they must choose half of their Drop Pod units (rounding up) to make a Drop Pod Assault. These units arrive on their controlling player’s first player turn.
The arrival of the remaining Drop Pods in the player’s force is rolled for as usual for the mission. A unit that Deep Strikes via Drop Pod may not assault in the turn it arrives.

Heat Blast (Deep Strike): Immediately after deploying, measure a radius of 3D3&quot; horizontally from the main hull.  Any model caught in the blast suffers a S6 AP5 hit with no cover saves.  Vehicles are struck on their weakest armour value.  This counts as a flamer based attack.

Heat Blast (Fire Sweep): Any unit the model passes over suffers a S6 AP5 hit with no cover saves.  Vehicles are struck on their weakest armour value.  This counts as a flamer based attack.  Unit being hit determines wound allocation.  On a D6 of 1, the Drop Pod suffers a penetrating hit.</description>

              <description>Units with this special rule may always attempt to Regroup at their normal Leadership value, regardless of casualties.

In addition to these benefits, units  will also have a number of additional special rules and abilities specific to their ‘named’ Legion, all of which will be defined in the Legiones Astartes Army List and other future Forge World publications.

If an army represents a Legion which does not yet have its own unique Legiones Astartes rule, the controlling player may instead add either the Stubborn or Furious Charge special rule to the standard provisions of this rule in the interim.</description>

              <description>ARTILLERY

Some weapons are so large and cumbersome that they are usually mounted on vehicles, but are sometimes utilised by artillery teams on foot, particularly if the battlefield’s terrain is not suitable for vehicles. These weapons are typically mounted on wheeled supports as they are too heavy to be carried across the battlefield.

THE UNIT

Artillery units comprise a number of crew models and the gun models themselves. These units can include several different types of models. The following is an example of a typical Artillery unit:

WS BS S T W I A Ld Sv

- - - 7 2 - - - 3+

If all of the crew models are killed, the guns are immediately removed as well. Sometimes, the player has the choice of adding leaders or additional models to the crew of an Artillery unit. These models are part of the crew in all respects and can operate the guns as normal, even if they are otherwise slightly different from the rest of the crew. Independent Characters who join the unit, however, do not count as crew and cannot operate the guns.

MOVEMENT PHASE

Artillery units need at least one crewman per gun in order for the unit to move. If an Artillery unit does not have at least one crewman per gun, then it may not move.

SHOOTING WITH ARTILLERY

One crewman that is within 2&quot; of a gun in the Shooting phase can fire it. The crewmen firing the gun cannot fire any weapons they are carrying, while the other crew members (and any Independent Characters in the unit) are free to fire their side arms, provided the whole unit shoots at the same target. When firing the guns, there must be a line of sight to the target from both the gun model and the crewman firing it (unless they are firing Barrage weapons). Ranges are measured from the barrel on the gun model.

SHOOTING AT ARTILLERY

If shooting at an Artillery unit, the Toughness of the guns is always used whilst at least one gun remains. Any wounds caused are still allocated to the closest model first. If an Artillery unit chooses to Go to Ground, this does not increase the guns’ cover save – only the crew benefit.

ASSAULT PHASE

Artillery units cannot charge as long as they include any gun models. If an Artillery unit is charged, only the crew models can fire Overwatch. After Overwatch has been resolved, move the charging models into base contact with the crew and Artillery gun models as normal. No wounds can be allocated to the guns. All engaged enemies roll To Hit and To Wound against the crew, even if they are only engaged with the guns. Engaged crew models can fight back, but the Artillery guns cannot.

MORALE AND FALL BACK MOVES

For the purposes of Morale checks and other Leadership tests, and for combat resolution, always ignore the gun models. Because they need at least one crewman per gun in order to move, if an Artillery unit does not have one crewman per gun when it is forced to Fall Back, any gun models without crewmen are abandoned and immediately removed as casualties. The rest of the unit then Falls Back as normal. If an Artillery unit is forced to Fall Back from close combat and the enemy is free to make a Sweeping Advance, then the Artillery unit automatically loses the Initiative test and is caught and destroyed by the victor.

ARTILLERY AND LOOK OUT, SIR

A wound cannot be re-allocated onto a gun model from a successful Look Out, Sir roll (see page 94).</description>

              <description>A super-heavy vehicle is so large and strongly built that weapons which degrade the armour of smaller vehicles will not effect it.  Because of this, any attack that says that the target model is destroyed, wrecked, Explodes! or is otherwise removed from play inflicts D3 Hull Points of damage on a Super-heavy vehicle instead.

In addition, any attacks or special abilities that permanently lower the Armour Values of a target vehicle do not affect a Super-heavy vehicle.  Note that attacks or abilities that count the Armour Value as being lower, but do not actually change it, work normally.</description>

In most circumstances, this will mean that, when moving, the unit rolls 3D6 and picks the highest roll. Furthermore, a model with the Move Through Cover special rule automatically passes Dangerous Terrain tests.</description>

              <description>Relentless models can shoot with Heavy, Salvo or Ordnance weapons, counting as stationary, even if they moved in the previous Movement phase. They are also allowed to charge in the same turn they fire Heavy, Ordnance, Rapid Fire or Salvo weapons.</description>

              <description>All of the close combat attacks, except Hammer of Wrath attacks, of a model with this special rule are resolved at AP2 (unless it’s attacking with an AP1 weapon). Additionally, when it makes its close combat attacks, it can choose instead to make a single Smash Attack. If it does so, roll To Hit as normal, but resolve the Attack at double the model’s Strength (to a maximum of 10). Furthermore, a model making a Smash Attack can re-roll its armour penetration rolls, but must abide by the second result.</description>
