          <description>CENTURION – draft ruleset 1.1
The Centurion Discipline is a middle-ground between Zone Mortalis* and Frontline* games.
Aesthetically drawing inspiration from Warhammer 40k 2nd Edition, and rules-wise
providing more narrative games where infantry and characters are the focus of
the action. Some units are restricted in this discipline, the narrative shaped by
dense terrain in which tanks and aircraft are not viable, yet the battle is still a
savage tale of retribution and massacre.

Centurion games are played on a 6x4 with more terrain than Frontline games,
using Shadow War missions and a points level of 1500-2000 to represent smaller
actions, insurgency, and tactical skirmishes.

Infantry, Walkers, and Speeders should be the focus of your army and the
following unit are restricted:

Tanks, Fliers, Drop Pods, Superheavies are not allowed.
Bikes, Attack Bikes, Jet Bikes, Artillery, Monstrous Creatures, Leviathan
Siege Dreadnoughts are 0-1 choices.

Note this precludes some Rites of War and Army Lists from Centurion mode.</description>

                  <description>Effects
All units in the army eligible to take a Rhino as a Dedicated Transport may instead select Legion Drop Pods or Dreadclaw Drop Pods as Dedicated Transports.
When taken as part of this Rite of War, talons of Legion Dreadnoughts and Contemptor Dreadnoughts must be given either Dreadclaw Drop Pods or Legion Dreadnought Drop Pods Dedicated Transports and must arrive via Deep Strike. In this case, a talon of multiple Dreadnoughts must attempt to land within unit coherency when they are deployed via Deep Strike, but follow the Dreadnought Talon rules afterwards.
Units and models in Terminator armour gain the Deep Strike special rule.
Legion Rapier Weapons Batteries may select Legion Drop Pods as Dedicated Transports.
Deathstorm Drop Pods may be selected as Fast Attack choices.
Limitations
Units that cannot be deployed via Deep Strike, either by having access to the special rule themselves or because they cannot be carried in a transport vehicle that has it (infantry in Drop Pods, for example), may not be chosenas part of the army.
You may not take a Fortification Allied Detachment.
All units purchased Dedicated Transports in this army must begin the game transported within them</description>

                  <description>In order for a unit to be able to Deep Strike, all models in the unit must have the Deep Strike special rule and the unit must start the game in Reserve. When placing the unit in Reserve, you must tell your opponent that it will be arriving by Deep Strike (sometimes called Deep Strike Reserve). Some units must arrive by Deep Strike. They always begin the game in Reserve and always arrive by Deep Strike.

Arriving by Deep Strike
Roll for the arrival of all Deep Striking units as specified in the rules for Reserves and then deploy them as follows:
• First, place one model from the unit anywhere on the table, in the position where you would like it to arrive, and roll for scatter to determine the model’s final position. If a vehicle scatters when arriving via Deep Strike, do not change its facing – it must continue to face the same direction as it did before you rolled for scatter.
• Next, the unit’s remaining models are arranged around the first one. Models must be placed in base contact with the first model and begin to form a circle around it. When the first circle is complete, a further concentric circle must be placed with each model touching the circle inside it. Each circle must include as many models as will fit.
• Models deploying via Deep Strike treat all difficult terrain as dangerous terrain.
In the Movement phase during which they arrive, Deep Striking units may not move any further, other than to disembark from a Deep Striking Transport vehicle if they are in one.
Units Deep Striking into ruins are placed on the ground floor. Deep Striking units count non-ruined buildings (except for their battlements) as impassable terrain.
In that turn’s Shooting phase, these units can fire (or Run, Turbo-boost or move Flat Out) as normal, and count as having moved in the previous Movement phase. Vehicles, except for Walkers, count as having moved at Combat Speed (even Immobilised vehicles). This can affect the number of weapons they can fire with their full Ballistic Skill.
In that turn’s Assault phase, however, these units cannot charge. This also applies to units that have disembarked from Transports that arrived by Deep Strike that turn.

Deep Strike and Transports
Units do not confer the Deep Strike special rule onto a Transport vehicle they are embarked inside. A Transport vehicle with Deep Strike may Deep Strike regardless of whether its passengers have Deep Strike or not.

Deep Strike Mishaps
Deep Striking onto a crowded battlefield can be dangerous, as one may miss the intended objective or even materialise inside solid rock! If any of the models in a Deep Striking unit cannot be deployed, because at least one model would land partially or fully off the table, in impassable terrain, on top of a friendly model, or on top of or within 1&quot; of an enemy model, something has gone wrong. The controlling player must roll on the Deep Strike Mishap table and apply the results. If the unfortunate unit is also a Transport, the Deep Strike Mishap result applies to both the unit and anything embarked within it.


Deep Strike Mishap Table
D6 - Effect
1 - Terrible Accident! Teleporting units are lost in the Warp, deep striking jump units are shot down, or some other suitably dramatic event occurs.
The entire unit is destroyed!

2-3 - Misplaced. The coordinates were inaccurate or the enemy has jammed your instruments.
Your opponent may deploy the unit anywhere on the table (excluding impassable terrain, but including difficult terrain, which of course counts as dangerous for Deep Striking units), in a valid Deep Strike formation, but without rolling for scatter. Units embarked on a misplaced Transport can disembark during their Movement phase as normal.

4-6 - Delayed. Because of mechanical failure or enemy action, the reinforcements are delayed.
The unit is placed in Ongoing Reserves.</description>

Bulky models count as two models and Very Bulky models as three models for the purposes of working out when the Night Lords outnumber their victims.
• Nostraman Blood: All models with this special rule fall back 1&quot; further than normal. If they fail a Pinning test, they may, if the controlling player wishes, fall back instead of becoming pinned - just as if they had failed a Morale check for taking casualties in the Shooting phase.
• Night Vision: All models in a Night Lords primary detachment (not just those with the Legiones Astartes (Night Lords) special rule) have the Night Vision special rule.
• From the Shadows: All models with this special rule have a cover save of 5 on the first game turn, even in open ground. This rule can be combined with the effects of Stealth, etc, as normal, but other forms of cover the model might be in which provide a higher save supersede it.
• Seeds of Dissent: If an army’s Warlord is slain, each unit in the army with this special rule must make an immediate Morale check as if they had suffered 25% losses from shooting</description>

                  <description>Units with this special rule may always attempt to Regroup at their normal Leadership value, regardless of casualties.

In addition to these benefits, units  will also have a number of additional special rules and abilities specific to their ‘named’ Legion, all of which will be defined in the Legiones Astartes Army List and other future Forge World publications.

If an army represents a Legion which does not yet have its own unique Legiones Astartes rule, the controlling player may instead add either the Stubborn or Furious Charge special rule to the standard provisions of this rule in the interim.</description>

If constructing an army using the Crusade Force Organisation chart, this would mean that an army would be required to take at least one HQ choice and two Troops choices. These compulsory choices are intended to ensure that the core of each army is illustrative of the force represented by the Army List in use, and that all armies are capable of properly participating in the varied missions available to players in the Age of Darkness.</description>

              <description>If any units with the Legiones Astartes (Night Lords) special rule outnumber one or more enemy infantry units during any Initiative step in which they fight in assault, they gain +1 To Hit and To Wound (to a maximum of a 2+). Bulky models count as two models and Very Bulky models as three models on both sides for the purposes of working out when Night Lords outnumber their victims.</description>

              <description>Units with this special rule may always attempt to Regroup at their normal Leadership value, regardless of casualties.

In addition to these benefits, units  will also have a number of additional special rules and abilities specific to their ‘named’ Legion, all of which will be defined in the Legiones Astartes Army List and other future Forge World publications.

If an army represents a Legion which does not yet have its own unique Legiones Astartes rule, the controlling player may instead add either the Stubborn or Furious Charge special rule to the standard provisions of this rule in the interim.</description>

              <description>While at least five models remain in the unit armed with bolters or bolt pistols, the squad can elect to make a Fury of the Legion attack in the Shooting phase so long as they did not move, arrive via Deep Strike or disembark a vehicle earlier in that player turn. Models making a Fury of the Legion attack may fire twice with their bolters or bolt pistols against a single target (note that in the case of a combi-weapon, only the bolter part may fire twice).

                  Owing to the massive expenditure of ammunition involved, once a squad has made a Fury of the Legion attack it may not use Overwatch fire later that turn or fire in the Shooting phase of their next player turn, but may otherwise move, fight in assault, run, etc, normally (place a counter or note next to the unit to represent this). Fury of the Legion attacks may not be used for Snap Shots, and models joining the unit do not benefit from this rule and must fire normally, as does any non-bolter weapon used by the squad at the same time as the Fury of the Legion attack is made</description>

              <description>One box on a Force Organisation chart allows you to make one selection from that part of your army list. Dark boxes indicate compulsory selections, which must be included as part of the army, while the lighter boxes indicate optional choices, which are only included as part of the army if the player in question chooses to do so. If constructing an army using the Crusade Force Organisation chart, this would mean that an army would be required to take at least one HQ choice and two Troops choices. These compulsory choices are intended to ensure that the core of each army is illustrative of the force represented by the Army List in use, and that all armies are capable of properly participating in the varied missions available to players in the Age of Darkness.</description>

              <description>Units with this special rule may always attempt to Regroup at their normal Leadership value, regardless of casualties.

In addition to these benefits, units  will also have a number of additional special rules and abilities specific to their ‘named’ Legion, all of which will be defined in the Legiones Astartes Army List and other future Forge World publications.

If an army represents a Legion which does not yet have its own unique Legiones Astartes rule, the controlling player may instead add either the Stubborn or Furious Charge special rule to the standard provisions of this rule in the interim.</description>

              <description>One box on a Force Organisation chart allows you to make one selection from that part of your army list. Dark boxes indicate compulsory selections, which must be included as part of the army, while the lighter boxes indicate optional choices, which are only included as part of the army if the player in question chooses to do so. If constructing an army using the Crusade Force Organisation chart, this would mean that an army would be required to take at least one HQ choice and two Troops choices. These compulsory choices are intended to ensure that the core of each army is illustrative of the force represented by the Army List in use, and that all armies are capable of properly participating in the varied missions available to players in the Age of Darkness.</description>

              <description>Units with this special rule may always attempt to Regroup at their normal Leadership value, regardless of casualties.

In addition to these benefits, units  will also have a number of additional special rules and abilities specific to their ‘named’ Legion, all of which will be defined in the Legiones Astartes Army List and other future Forge World publications.

If an army represents a Legion which does not yet have its own unique Legiones Astartes rule, the controlling player may instead add either the Stubborn or Furious Charge special rule to the standard provisions of this rule in the interim.</description>

This Attack does not benefit from any of the model’s special rules (such as Furious Charge, Rending etc.). This Attack is resolved during the Fight sub-phase at the Initiative 10 step, but does not grant the model an additional Pile In move.
If a model with this special rule charges a building or vehicle, the hit is resolved against the Armour Value of the facing the charging model is touching. If a model with this special rule charges a building or vehicle that is a Transport or a Chariot, the hit is resolved against the building or vehicle, not the occupants or the rider.</description>

This Attack does not benefit from any of the model’s special rules (such as Furious Charge, Rending etc.). This Attack is resolved during the Fight sub-phase at the Initiative 10 step, but does not grant the model an additional Pile In move.
If a model with this special rule charges a building or vehicle, the hit is resolved against the Armour Value of the facing the charging model is touching. If a model with this special rule charges a building or vehicle that is a Transport or a Chariot, the hit is resolved against the building or vehicle, not the occupants or the rider.</description>

The decision must be made before any To Hit rolls have been made.

              <description>ARTILLERY

Some weapons are so large and cumbersome that they are usually mounted on vehicles, but are sometimes utilised by artillery teams on foot, particularly if the battlefield’s terrain is not suitable for vehicles. These weapons are typically mounted on wheeled supports as they are too heavy to be carried across the battlefield.

THE UNIT

Artillery units comprise a number of crew models and the gun models themselves. These units can include several different types of models. The following is an example of a typical Artillery unit:

WS BS S T W I A Ld Sv

- - - 7 2 - - - 3+

If all of the crew models are killed, the guns are immediately removed as well. Sometimes, the player has the choice of adding leaders or additional models to the crew of an Artillery unit. These models are part of the crew in all respects and can operate the guns as normal, even if they are otherwise slightly different from the rest of the crew. Independent Characters who join the unit, however, do not count as crew and cannot operate the guns.

MOVEMENT PHASE

Artillery units need at least one crewman per gun in order for the unit to move. If an Artillery unit does not have at least one crewman per gun, then it may not move.

SHOOTING WITH ARTILLERY

One crewman that is within 2&quot; of a gun in the Shooting phase can fire it. The crewmen firing the gun cannot fire any weapons they are carrying, while the other crew members (and any Independent Characters in the unit) are free to fire their side arms, provided the whole unit shoots at the same target. When firing the guns, there must be a line of sight to the target from both the gun model and the crewman firing it (unless they are firing Barrage weapons). Ranges are measured from the barrel on the gun model.

SHOOTING AT ARTILLERY

If shooting at an Artillery unit, the Toughness of the guns is always used whilst at least one gun remains. Any wounds caused are still allocated to the closest model first. If an Artillery unit chooses to Go to Ground, this does not increase the guns’ cover save – only the crew benefit.

ASSAULT PHASE

Artillery units cannot charge as long as they include any gun models. If an Artillery unit is charged, only the crew models can fire Overwatch. After Overwatch has been resolved, move the charging models into base contact with the crew and Artillery gun models as normal. No wounds can be allocated to the guns. All engaged enemies roll To Hit and To Wound against the crew, even if they are only engaged with the guns. Engaged crew models can fight back, but the Artillery guns cannot.

MORALE AND FALL BACK MOVES

For the purposes of Morale checks and other Leadership tests, and for combat resolution, always ignore the gun models. Because they need at least one crewman per gun in order to move, if an Artillery unit does not have one crewman per gun when it is forced to Fall Back, any gun models without crewmen are abandoned and immediately removed as casualties. The rest of the unit then Falls Back as normal. If an Artillery unit is forced to Fall Back from close combat and the enemy is free to make a Sweeping Advance, then the Artillery unit automatically loses the Initiative test and is caught and destroyed by the victor.

ARTILLERY AND LOOK OUT, SIR

A wound cannot be re-allocated onto a gun model from a successful Look Out, Sir roll (see page 94).</description>

              <description>At the start of each Fight sub-phase, a unit in base contact with one or more enemy models that cause Fear must take a Leadership test (called a Fear test) before any blows are struck. If the test is passed, all is well and there is no effect. If the test is failed, the unit succumbs to fear – all models in the unit have their Weapon Skill reduced to 1 for the remainder of that Fight sub-phase. Note that a model that causes Fear is not itself immune to Fear, and will still need to take a Fear test if it is base contact with any enemy models that cause Fear.</description>

              <description>A super-heavy vehicle is so large and strongly built that weapons which degrade the armour of smaller vehicles will not effect it.  Because of this, any attack that says that the target model is destroyed, wrecked, Explodes! or is otherwise removed from play inflicts D3 Hull Points of damage on a Super-heavy vehicle instead.

In addition, any attacks or special abilities that permanently lower the Armour Values of a target vehicle do not affect a Super-heavy vehicle.  Note that attacks or abilities that count the Armour Value as being lower, but do not actually change it, work normally.</description>

              <description>All of the close combat attacks, except Hammer of Wrath attacks, of a model with this special rule are resolved at AP2 (unless it’s attacking with an AP1 weapon). Additionally, when it makes its close combat attacks, it can choose instead to make a single Smash Attack. If it does so, roll To Hit as normal, but resolve the Attack at double the model’s Strength (to a maximum of 10). Furthermore, a model making a Smash Attack can re-roll its armour penetration rolls, but must abide by the second result.</description>
