          <description>CENTURION – draft ruleset 1.1
The Centurion Discipline is a middle-ground between Zone Mortalis* and Frontline* games.
Aesthetically drawing inspiration from Warhammer 40k 2nd Edition, and rules-wise
providing more narrative games where infantry and characters are the focus of
the action. Some units are restricted in this discipline, the narrative shaped by
dense terrain in which tanks and aircraft are not viable, yet the battle is still a
savage tale of retribution and massacre.

Centurion games are played on a 6x4 with more terrain than Frontline games,
using Shadow War missions and a points level of 1500-2000 to represent smaller
actions, insurgency, and tactical skirmishes.

Infantry, Walkers, and Speeders should be the focus of your army and the
following unit are restricted:

Tanks, Fliers, Drop Pods, Superheavies are not allowed.
Bikes, Attack Bikes, Jet Bikes, Artillery, Monstrous Creatures, Leviathan
Siege Dreadnoughts are 0-1 choices.

Note this precludes some Rites of War and Army Lists from Centurion mode.</description>

                  <description>Effects
• Cover of Darkness: The force may impose Night Fighting for the duration of the first game turn of any mission on a D6 roll of 2. Night Fighting imposed in this manner carries on to the second game turn on a roll of 4, and on to the third turn on a roll of a 6. While this special Night Fighting condition is in effect, all models with the Legiones Astartes (Night Lords) special rule gain 1 Initiative and 1&quot; to their Run distances.
• Terror Tactics: Night Lords Terror Squads must be taken as the Compulsory Troops choices for a force using this Rite of War, and may be taken as additional Troops choices if desired.
• Claw Assault: Legion Tactical Squads, Legion Veteran Tactical Squads and Night Lords Terror Squads may take either Dreadclaw Drop Pods or Legion Drop Pods as Dedicated Transports so long as their number does not exceed the vehicle’s Transport capacity and they begin the game held in reserve inside the transport.
Limitations
• Detachments using this Rite of War must take an additional Compulsory Troops choice in addition to that usually required on their Force Organisation chart.
• Detachments using this Rite of War may only take a single Pleavy Support choice as part of their Force Organisation chart.
• Detachments using this Rite of War may only take a single Consul as part of their HQ choice.
• The controlling player may not take a Fortification or other Space Marine Legion allied detachment.</description>

• Nostraman Blood: All models with this special rule fall back 1&quot; further than normal. If they fail a Pinning test, they may, if the controlling player wishes, fall back instead of becoming pinned - just as if they had failed a Morale check for taking casualties in the Shooting phase.

• From the Shadows: All models with this special rule have a cover save of 5 on the first game turn, even in open ground. This rule can be combined with the effects of Stealth, etc, as normal, but other forms of cover the model might be in which provide a higher save supersede it.
• Seeds of Dissent: If an army’s Warlord is slain, each unit in the army with this special rule must make an immediate Morale check as if they had suffered 25% losses from shooting</description>

              <description>While at least five models remain in the unit armed with bolters or bolt pistols, the squad can elect to make a Fury of the Legion attack in the Shooting phase so long as they did not move, arrive via Deep Strike or disembark a vehicle earlier in that player turn. Models making a Fury of the Legion attack may fire twice with their bolters or bolt pistols against a single target (note that in the case of a combi-weapon, only the bolter part may fire twice).

                  Owing to the massive expenditure of ammunition involved, once a squad has made a Fury of the Legion attack it may not use Overwatch fire later that turn or fire in the Shooting phase of their next player turn, but may otherwise move, fight in assault, run, etc, normally (place a counter or note next to the unit to represent this). Fury of the Legion attacks may not be used for Snap Shots, and models joining the unit do not benefit from this rule and must fire normally, as does any non-bolter weapon used by the squad at the same time as the Fury of the Legion attack is made</description>

              <description>One box on a Force Organisation chart allows you to make one selection from that part of your army list. Dark boxes indicate compulsory selections, which must be included as part of the army, while the lighter boxes indicate optional choices, which are only included as part of the army if the player in question chooses to do so. If constructing an army using the Crusade Force Organisation chart, this would mean that an army would be required to take at least one HQ choice and two Troops choices. These compulsory choices are intended to ensure that the core of each army is illustrative of the force represented by the Army List in use, and that all armies are capable of properly participating in the varied missions available to players in the Age of Darkness.</description>

              <description>While at least five models remain in the unit armed with bolters or bolt pistols, the squad can elect to make a Fury of the Legion attack in the Shooting phase so long as they did not move, arrive via Deep Strike or disembark a vehicle earlier in that player turn. Models making a Fury of the Legion attack may fire twice with their bolters or bolt pistols against a single target (note that in the case of a combi-weapon, only the bolter part may fire twice).

                  Owing to the massive expenditure of ammunition involved, once a squad has made a Fury of the Legion attack it may not use Overwatch fire later that turn or fire in the Shooting phase of their next player turn, but may otherwise move, fight in assault, run, etc, normally (place a counter or note next to the unit to represent this). Fury of the Legion attacks may not be used for Snap Shots, and models joining the unit do not benefit from this rule and must fire normally, as does any non-bolter weapon used by the squad at the same time as the Fury of the Legion attack is made</description>

              <description>ARTILLERY

Some weapons are so large and cumbersome that they are usually mounted on vehicles, but are sometimes utilised by artillery teams on foot, particularly if the battlefield’s terrain is not suitable for vehicles. These weapons are typically mounted on wheeled supports as they are too heavy to be carried across the battlefield.

THE UNIT

Artillery units comprise a number of crew models and the gun models themselves. These units can include several different types of models. The following is an example of a typical Artillery unit:

WS BS S T W I A Ld Sv

- - - 7 2 - - - 3+

If all of the crew models are killed, the guns are immediately removed as well. Sometimes, the player has the choice of adding leaders or additional models to the crew of an Artillery unit. These models are part of the crew in all respects and can operate the guns as normal, even if they are otherwise slightly different from the rest of the crew. Independent Characters who join the unit, however, do not count as crew and cannot operate the guns.

MOVEMENT PHASE

Artillery units need at least one crewman per gun in order for the unit to move. If an Artillery unit does not have at least one crewman per gun, then it may not move.

SHOOTING WITH ARTILLERY

One crewman that is within 2&quot; of a gun in the Shooting phase can fire it. The crewmen firing the gun cannot fire any weapons they are carrying, while the other crew members (and any Independent Characters in the unit) are free to fire their side arms, provided the whole unit shoots at the same target. When firing the guns, there must be a line of sight to the target from both the gun model and the crewman firing it (unless they are firing Barrage weapons). Ranges are measured from the barrel on the gun model.

SHOOTING AT ARTILLERY

If shooting at an Artillery unit, the Toughness of the guns is always used whilst at least one gun remains. Any wounds caused are still allocated to the closest model first. If an Artillery unit chooses to Go to Ground, this does not increase the guns’ cover save – only the crew benefit.

ASSAULT PHASE

Artillery units cannot charge as long as they include any gun models. If an Artillery unit is charged, only the crew models can fire Overwatch. After Overwatch has been resolved, move the charging models into base contact with the crew and Artillery gun models as normal. No wounds can be allocated to the guns. All engaged enemies roll To Hit and To Wound against the crew, even if they are only engaged with the guns. Engaged crew models can fight back, but the Artillery guns cannot.

MORALE AND FALL BACK MOVES

For the purposes of Morale checks and other Leadership tests, and for combat resolution, always ignore the gun models. Because they need at least one crewman per gun in order to move, if an Artillery unit does not have one crewman per gun when it is forced to Fall Back, any gun models without crewmen are abandoned and immediately removed as casualties. The rest of the unit then Falls Back as normal. If an Artillery unit is forced to Fall Back from close combat and the enemy is free to make a Sweeping Advance, then the Artillery unit automatically loses the Initiative test and is caught and destroyed by the victor.

ARTILLERY AND LOOK OUT, SIR

A wound cannot be re-allocated onto a gun model from a successful Look Out, Sir roll (see page 94).</description>

              <description>At the start of each Fight sub-phase, a unit in base contact with one or more enemy models that cause Fear must take a Leadership test (called a Fear test) before any blows are struck. If the test is passed, all is well and there is no effect. If the test is failed, the unit succumbs to fear – all models in the unit have their Weapon Skill reduced to 1 for the remainder of that Fight sub-phase. Note that a model that causes Fear is not itself immune to Fear, and will still need to take a Fear test if it is base contact with any enemy models that cause Fear.</description>

              <description>A super-heavy vehicle is so large and strongly built that weapons which degrade the armour of smaller vehicles will not effect it.  Because of this, any attack that says that the target model is destroyed, wrecked, Explodes! or is otherwise removed from play inflicts D3 Hull Points of damage on a Super-heavy vehicle instead.

In addition, any attacks or special abilities that permanently lower the Armour Values of a target vehicle do not affect a Super-heavy vehicle.  Note that attacks or abilities that count the Armour Value as being lower, but do not actually change it, work normally.</description>

              <description>At the start of each Fight sub-phase, a unit in base contact with one or more enemy models that cause Fear must take a Leadership test (called a Fear test) before any blows are struck. If the test is passed, all is well and there is no effect. If the test is failed, the unit succumbs to fear – all models in the unit have their Weapon Skill reduced to 1 for the remainder of that Fight sub-phase. Note that a model that causes Fear is not itself immune to Fear, and will still need to take a Fear test if it is base contact with any enemy models that cause Fear.</description>

              <description>If a model with this special rule ends its charge move in base or hull contact with an enemy model, it makes one additional Attack that hits automatically and is resolved at the model’s unmodified Strength with AP-. This Attack does not benefit from any of the model’s special rules (such as Furious Charge, Rending etc.). This Attack is resolved during the Fight sub-phase at the Initiative 10 step, but does not grant the model an additional Pile In move.
If a model with this special rule charges a building or vehicle, the hit is resolved against the Armour Value of the facing the charging model is touching. If a model with this special rule charges a building or vehicle that is a Transport or a Chariot, the hit is resolved against the building or vehicle, not the occupants or the rider.</description>

              <description>A unit that contains at least one model with this special rule rolls an extra D6 when rolling to move through difficult terrain and is not slowed by charging through difficult terrain. In most circumstances, this will mean that, when moving, the unit rolls 3D6 and picks the highest roll. Furthermore, a model with the Move Through Cover special rule automatically passes Dangerous Terrain tests.</description>

              <description>Relentless models can shoot with Heavy, Salvo or Ordnance weapons, counting as stationary, even if they moved in the previous Movement phase. They are also allowed to charge in the same turn they fire Heavy, Ordnance, Rapid Fire or Salvo weapons.</description>

              <description>All of the close combat attacks, except Hammer of Wrath attacks, of a model with this special rule are resolved at AP2 (unless it’s attacking with an AP1 weapon). Additionally, when it makes its close combat attacks, it can choose instead to make a single Smash Attack. If it does so, roll To Hit as normal, but resolve the Attack at double the model’s Strength (to a maximum of 10). Furthermore, a model making a Smash Attack can re-roll its armour penetration rolls, but must abide by the second result.</description>
